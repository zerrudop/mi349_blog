    <h1>About this blog</h1>
    <p>
        This is the blog of the regular variety. Here is where discussions on life occur.
        This could be the most important of literature ever made, or just another fish
        in the ocean, that drowns like a freaking idiot.

    <p>
        I am just an average kid that no one understands. Mom, and dad, and Vicky always
        giving me commands. Doom and gloom up in my room is broken instantly by my magic
        little fish who grant my every wish. Because in reality, they are my oddparents,
        fairly oddparents. Wands and wings, floaty crowny things. Oddparents, fairly
        oddparents, Really mod, pea pod, buff bod, hot rod. Obtuse, rubber goose, green 
        moose, guava juice, Giant snake, birthday cake, large fries, chocolate shake!
        Oddparents, fairly oddparents. It flips your lid when you are a kid with fairly 
        oddparents!

          <h2>October 26, 2023: My People</h2>
          <h3>By: Patrick Zerrudo</h3>
          <p>
            Who are my people? I have a cultural event tonight with a bunch of strangers who
            know my name. Maybe I'm just terrible with names, and that's why they're strangers.
            Could there be more to it? Maybe I just don't allow myself to merge myself with a 
            group of people who look like me in fear of losing my individuality. This reminds
            me of the time I was cloned to be replaced. It was December 25, 1989. I had tasted
            my own blood for the first time. As I knelt, too weak to stand, the green glass door
            in front of me opened. He had everything I had, except he was an inch taller and was
            blond. He was basically perfect. It was like looking into a mirror. My vision was
            blurred, so I don't know if I saw it right, but a third arm grew from his sternum to
            the sound of cracking ribs. It reached out and gripped me by my throat and lifted me.
            It felt wet, slimy, and smelled of moldy wood. I could have sworn it felt as if it
            was still growing while it choked me. My doppelganger leaned in, his breath grazing
            my ear. His words have stuck to me as the sins on my back. He said, "Ok word limit bye".

            As the start of this blog, I want to talk about my weekend. It was a long one.
            Visited home and did a whole lot of nothing. Family lunch rolls around before 
            I leave, and it gets awkward when my mom yells at my brother for not having a
            career yet. It kind of ruined my meal. I do want a career in my future, but I
            also do not want to be tied down to it, and I am still young, so I want to
            experience so much more. What to do... I now have to fill out the word count.
            This reminds me of the time I was stuck on a Somalian pirate ship. It was dark,
            wet, and the smell of rotting fish was pungent. As I called to my partner, Krag
            Farlane, I was only met with the creaks of old wood and the steady waves around
            me. Suddenly, I was blinded by the sudden and fierce appearance of the sun. I
            wandered upon the deck with my eyes only. Somehow, no one was there. I looked
            down to find a bowl of alphabet soup. The letters almost seemed to spell a word,
            yet it was a language I could not understand. Ok word limit bye.
